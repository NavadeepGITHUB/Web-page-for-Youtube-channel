        but i dont know more than these operations.
    </p>    
        <ol>
            <li>Today- I will try to understand complete HTML. </li>
            <ul> 
                <li>In HTML it is like building the walls.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Tomorrow-I will focus on CSS.</li>
            <ul>
